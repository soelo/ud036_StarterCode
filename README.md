# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

##Definition
This program will generate an html file that displays your favorite movies and plays the trailer when you click on a poster.

##Installation

- All files are available at this [github repository](https://github.com/soelo/ud036_StarterCode)
- Download the zip file.
- Unzip the files into a folder.
- Open the files in [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/idle.html).
- Execute entertainment_center.py and the program will generate a file called fresh_tomatoes.html and open it in your default web browser.


##Customization

To change the movies shown, edit the entertainment_center.py file. 
This requires a movie title, release date, storyline, poster image, and the  trailer url from youtube.
Generate a new version of the website by executing entertainment_center.py using a Python shell like IDLE.
Publish this website on your own domain or share it with friends!
